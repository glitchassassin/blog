At JBS, I've been working on custom software projects with Tidal Basin, one of our clients. [Here's a writeup](https://www.jbs.dev/resources/resource-center/case-studies/emergency-and-disaster-consulting-firm-expedites-relief-survivors-new-grant-system/) about our [Phoenix OneCase project](https://www.tidalbasingroup.com/education/brochures/phoenix-onecase/).

> Phoenix OneCase designed by TB Technologies and JBS Dev (the team), is a dynamic, customizable, cloud-based platform. The backend was written in Django—a high-level Python web framework that facilitates rapid development with a clean and pragmatic design. The frontend was developed using REST API to make integrations over the Internet simple and scalable. React, a free and open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) based on components, was also used to develop a dynamic and performant application.  
> The functionality of Phoenix OneCase allowed Tidal Basin project managers to quickly set up a new disaster relief program without hard coding or the help of developers (as was the case with many legacy systems). Now, a project manager could quickly build a custom form with specific information fields that apply to a particular program. This includes data integrity checks such as required fields, address validation, format masks, and data type checking.  
> With a user-friendly forms engine, a project manager can fully customize the initial registration questions required from a new applicant requesting assistance and/or disaster relief. These questions could be created from either pre-defined templates or entirely from scratch—something that was difficult and timely to do on the legacy platform.  
> To make it even more flexible and customizable, the team designed Phoenix OneCase to have configurable workflows with tracking that meets the needs of the case or grant management program. This includes phases, gatekeeping, state management, quality assurance, and case manager functions defined by role, phase, project, and program. The application also allows case managers to upload relevant documents for viewing and tracking.

As the architect on the JBS side of the project, I helped lead the team's discussions around technology and infrastructure choices. We had a small team of 4-6 experienced devs, so making technical decisions by discussion and consensus worked well.
