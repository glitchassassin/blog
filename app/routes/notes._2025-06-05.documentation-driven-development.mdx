Let's talk about reskilling for the agentic future!

The rise of coding agents - [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/), [OpenHands](https://all-hands.dev/), and many more - inspires a range of emotional reactions for developers, from fear to anger to acceptance to excitement. Will the robots take our jobs?

The future is cloudy, but I believe the answer will be "yes and no." We will still have jobs - but they won't look the same.

## Levels of Abstraction

When I first started using Cursor, I fell in love with its nearly psychic Tab model. It seemed to know exactly what I wanted, most of the time, and I got pretty good at predicting when it would give me what I wanted and when I should ignore it and write something myself. This cooperative model felt great: it's the same as regular development, but you can skip the boring parts and move faster!

I liked to think that this meant we were heading in a direction of human augmentation - making us better at the things we are already doing - rather than replacement.

That's still true, at a high level, but as I've been working more with Cursor's Agent mode, I'm beginning to think that we're about to shift to a higher level of abstraction.

In the same way that operating systems accelerate development by abstracting away the details of hardware, and browsers further abstract away the details of operating systems, AI agents are on the verge of abstracting away a significant chunk of the software development lifecycle.

## Documentation Driven Development

I'm working on a side project for our church. We have an annual Single Moms' Oil Change, where men from our church set up shop in the church parking lot and do a free oil change for single moms in our community. Last year, I think we had twelve stations set up and processed more than a hundred vehicles during the event.

This takes some organization, of course. Keeping track of where any given vehicle is at in the process is a challenge. So, I'm spinning up a status tracker.
